# Step by Step Tutorials on how to code a 64-Bit loader and kernel for OS Development

# NOTES  
- You will need the BOOTX64.EFI file from my other GitHub Repo. https://github.com/ThatOSDev/UEFI-Tuts  
- The drive.hdd file is included, I didn't realize this when I made the first video.  
- The bios64.bin file is for qemu to work. Otherwise it will fail to load.  
- Although the BUILD INSTRUCTIONS shows Windows, MAC or Linux, this tutorial series is using a windows host. However all code and makefile command switches should all work if you follow the build instructions.  

# TOOLS NEEDED  
- OSFMount ---- https://www.osforensics.com/tools/mount-disk-images.html  
- QEMU ( Optional ) ---- https://www.qemu.org/  
- VirtualBox ( Optional ) ---- https://www.virtualbox.org/  
- GCC for windows ---- https://nuwen.net/mingw.html
